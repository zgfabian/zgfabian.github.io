Recently, I found a [post](https://rpubs.com/muuankarski/210495) on mapping Eurostat data, which was written in 2016 by [Markus Kainu](https://github.com/muuankarski). It is not too old, but an important function within `{eurostat}` package became obsolote since then. `merge_eurostat_geodata()` have been abondoned because of switching to [simple features](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) standard. After some searching I found a solution to this issue[^issue]. (It also turned out that Markus Kainu is one of the devs of `{eurostat}`.) So, I made some minor changes in the original code base in order to reproduce and update some of the maps on NUTS2 (regional) level.

Here they are (Click to enlarge image):

I think they are quite pretty, although not fully comparable due to different value categories.

### Class struggle: Mind your objects' classes!

Plotting sf objects is easy with ggplot and geom_sf() unless you mess your data classes.
Pay special attention when you join data.frames of different classes. Consider the following scenarios:

As long as you get "sf", you are good to go with `geom_sf`. Otherwise you'll be stucked.
